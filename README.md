Description:
- The application takes 3 inputs from the user â€“ the number of questions, the category of the questions and the difficulty level of the questions.
- The list of categories is fetched from the webserver and populated onto the UI
- Using these inputs, it fetches a list of questions that meet the criteria and displays a question to the user.
- Once the user selects an option, their score increases based on whether it was right or wrong.
- The next question is asked, and this goes on until you have answered all the questions.
- Finally, the results of the score are displayed.
